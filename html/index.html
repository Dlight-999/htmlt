                <p>Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the most popular anime from 2019. The anime has been the center of attention since it aired episode 1. It was another Shounen anime, to begin with. However,  the unbelievably extraordinary animation and the god-like fight scenes gave us all the more reasons to love the anime. (Note: I on purpose didn’t include Nezuko in the reasons, that you will know in the end). Now, without any more delays let us start with the Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba season 3 Release date and other important updates.</p>

As lead singer of the death metal band Detroit Metal City, under the stage name Krauser II, he is made to perform loud songs filled with obscene lyrics - a far cry from the songs he used to write in school. But despite the fact that Negishi hates DMC's music, the Krauser side of him will do anything to put on a good show for his fans... even if it means making Negishi's life a misery!</p>
